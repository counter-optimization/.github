# Counter-Optimization

Counter-Optimization is a project from the University of Washington
Security and Privacy Research Lab and the PLSE group.

Here, we host our tools for performing hardening of sensitive software
libraries against microarchitectural side channels.

The name comes from the fact that the side channels we target occur as
a result of interesting microarchitectural optimizations, which we
then try to prevent.

# Tools

`cio` is the main tool available at this time. See the README in that
repository.
